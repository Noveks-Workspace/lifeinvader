## üìù **Configuration Example:**

```lua
Noveks_CFG = {}

-- ================================================
-- Discord Webhook for Admin Logs
Noveks_CFG.Log = {
    name = "LifeInvader",  -- Name of the bot for the Discord webhook
    color = "16711686",    -- Color for the embed in Discord (decimal)
    title = "LifeInvader", -- Title for the embed
    user = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID",  -- User log webhook URL
    admin = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID", -- Admin log webhook URL
}

-- ================================================
-- Lifeinvader Positions on the Map
Noveks_CFG.Positions = {
    vector3(-1082.4315, -247.6796, 36.7632),  -- Add more locations as needed
}

-- ================================================
-- Advertisement Settings
Noveks_CFG.MaxLetters = 150  -- Max characters allowed per ad
Noveks_CFG.MinLetters = 3    -- Minimum characters for an ad
Noveks_CFG.PricePerLetter = 2  -- Price per character
Noveks_CFG.MoneyAccount = "money"  -- Account from which the money is deducted
Noveks_CFG.LastVisibleAds = 10  -- Number of recent ads shown

-- ================================================
-- Marker Settings for LifeInvader Locations
Noveks_CFG.Marker = {
    type = 1,  -- Type of the marker
    scale = vector3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0),  -- Marker size
    rgba = {r = 255, g = 0, b = 0, a = 255},  -- Marker color (Red)
    bobUpAndDown = false,  -- Does the marker move?
    faceCamera = false,  -- Should the marker face the camera?
    rotate = false,  -- Should the marker rotate?
    distance = 50.0,  -- Distance at which marker becomes visible
    interactDistance = 2.0,  -- Distance at which players can interact
}

-- ================================================
-- Blip Settings on Map
Noveks_CFG.Blip = {
    sprite = 77,  -- Icon displayed for LifeInvader blip on the map
    color = 2,    -- Blip color (Green)
    label = "LifeInvader",  -- Text displayed for the blip
    scale = 0.6   -- Scale of the blip
}
```

## üöÄ **How It Works:**

1. **Ad Creation:**  
   Players can visit any of the marked Lifeinvader locations on the map and create ads by interacting with a designated marker.

2. **Ad Payment:**  
   Players pay for the ad based on the number of characters they use. The script automatically deducts the correct amount from the player's balance.

3. **Discord Logs:**  
   Every ad posted is logged in Discord via webhooks. Admins can easily track all ad activity and ensure everything is in order.

4. **Advertising Locations:**  
   The Lifeinvader locations are marked with a customizable marker. Players can easily find these spots on the map using the **blips** and **markers**.

5. **Anonymity Options:**  
   Players have the option to post ads anonymously or with their in-game name, offering flexibility in how ads are displayed.
